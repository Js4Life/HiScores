As a lead, When we countered Issues with flashlist. 

Firstly, Campaigns animation was not playing at card issue was resolved. 

Secondly ,We resolved error at start cta too (when no internet case)

I have added PR request against for these 2 issues with QA verification.

We have created MET PR merge release in slack request to solve these 2 issue.

But, Eventually we countered major RTL issue with flashlist at multiple places which couldn't solved (known issue at #met-dev) in short term due to nearing 23.10.0 release and needs decent QA effort. 

Further regression might lead to more issue , 

So we have insisted to revert back to Old FlatList and we created another PR merge request. Since we did not anticipated these issues and I acknowledge the scope was more than we expected. Apologies for this my end.

To conclude, I have tried my best to solve these issues with flashList at last moment with my current deliverables.
